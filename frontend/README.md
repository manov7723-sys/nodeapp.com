## Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update the `.env` file with your API URL:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

   **Note for GitHub Codespaces**: Use `http://localhost:3000` - Codespaces automatically forwards ports, so this will work correctly.
