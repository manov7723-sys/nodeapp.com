## Application Overview

This application is an employee management system designed for administrators and company employees. Administrators can add new employees, edit their data, assign positions, manage salary levels, and view salary increase histories. The system now includes comprehensive project management capabilities, allowing administrators to create and manage projects, assign multiple projects to employees, and track project status. The application automatically tracks salary raise dates for employees and sends notifications to administrators one month before the scheduled increase. Additionally, the system sends notifications about upcoming employee birthdays to help administrators congratulate employees on time.

Employees can update their personal information, such as name, contact details, and programming languages, while certain fields, like salary or position, are editable only by administrators. Employees can be assigned to multiple projects simultaneously, with project information visible on their profiles. All changes to employee profiles are automatically logged, and notifications are sent to administrators. Notifications also include employee status updates, such as assigned projects or English language proficiency. The application ensures regular data checks and sends important notifications through a task scheduler.

## Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

The easiest way to get started is using GitHub Codespaces, which provides a fully configured development environment in the cloud.

### Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Access to GitHub Codespaces

### Setup

1. Click the **Code** button on the GitHub repository page
2. Select the **Codespaces** tab
3. Click **Create codespace on main** (or your preferred branch)

GitHub will automatically:
- Set up the development environment
- Configure port forwarding for ports 3000 (backend) and 5173 (frontend)
- Install VS Code extensions for linting and formatting

### Running the Application

Once your Codespace is ready:

1. Copy environment files:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```

2. Start all services with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile dev up
   ```

   This starts:
   - **PostgreSQL Database** (internal only)
   - **Backend API** on port 3000 (automatically forwarded)
   - **Frontend Application** on port 5173 (automatically forwarded)

3. Access the application:
   - GitHub Codespaces will automatically forward ports
   - Click on the "Ports" tab in VS Code to see forwarded ports
   - Open the frontend URL (port 5173) in your browser

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `adminpassword`

### Manual Setup in Codespaces (without Docker)

If you prefer to run services manually:

1. **Terminal 1 - Backend**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Terminal 2 - Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend runs on port 3000 and frontend on port 5173. Both ports are automatically forwarded by Codespaces.

### Troubleshooting in Codespaces

**Connection Refused Errors:**
- Ensure backend is running on port 3000 (check terminal output)
- Verify `.env` file exists with `PORT=3000`
- Check port 3000 is forwarded in the Ports tab
- Ensure `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000` in `frontend/.env`

**CORS Errors:**
- Update `CORS_ORIGIN` in `.env` to match your Codespaces frontend URL
- Or set `CORS_ORIGIN=*` for development

For more details, see [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md).

## Quick Start with Docker

The application uses Docker Compose with profile-based execution for different environments.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (to clone the repository)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dreamquality/employee-management-api.git
   cd employee-management-api
   ```

2. Copy environment files:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   cp .env.e2e.example .env.e2e
   ```

3. (Optional) Update environment variables in `.env` files for your setup

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode (Recommended)
Start all services for local development:
```bash
docker compose --profile dev up
```

This starts:
- **PostgreSQL Database** (internal only - not exposed to host, accessible via `docker compose exec`)
- **Backend API** on port 3000
- **Frontend Application** on port 5173

Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `adminpassword`

#### CI Testing Mode
Run automated tests (used in GitHub Actions):
```bash
docker compose --profile ci up --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from test
```

Clean up after tests:
```bash
docker compose --profile ci down -v
```

#### E2E Testing Mode
Run end-to-end tests (requires Playwright setup):
```bash
docker compose --profile e2e up --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from playwright
```

> Note: The `playwright` service in `docker-compose.yml` currently uses a placeholder command that exits with an error. Playwright is not configured by default. Before using the `e2e` profile, configure Playwright in the frontend and add a `test:e2e` script to `frontend/package.json` that runs your E2E tests. Until this is done, running the E2E profile will fail as expected.
### Docker Compose Profiles

The application supports three profiles for different use cases:

| Profile | Services | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `dev` | app, frontend, db | Local development with hot reload |
| `ci` | app, db, test | Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines |
| `e2e` | app, frontend, db, playwright | End-to-end testing |

### Common Docker Commands

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clean slate)
docker compose down -v

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# View logs for specific service
docker compose logs -f app

# Access database
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d my_database

# Rebuild containers
docker compose build --no-cache
```

### Docker Architecture

The refactored Docker setup includes:

- **Isolated Networking**: Database is not exposed to host, services communicate via Docker network
- **Health Checks**: App service includes health check endpoint (`/health`) to ensure proper startup order
- **Environment Files**: All secrets and configuration in `.env` files (not committed to Git)
- **Entrypoint Scripts**: Migrations run automatically before app/tests start
- **Profile-Based**: Run only the services you need for your task

### Troubleshooting Docker

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "no configuration file provided" | Run: `cp .env.example .env` |
| Services don't start | Ensure you specify a profile: `--profile dev` |
| Can't connect to DB from host | DB is internal only, use: `docker compose exec db psql -U postgres` |
| Health check fails | Check logs: `docker compose logs app` |
| CORS errors in browser | Check `CORS_ORIGIN` in `.env` file |

### GitHub Actions Integration

The CI workflow automatically uses Docker Compose:

```yaml
- name: Setup environment files
  run: |
    cp .env.test.example .env.test
    cp .env.example .env

- name: Run tests with Docker Compose
  run: |
    docker compose --profile ci up --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from test
```

This ensures consistency between local development and CI environments.

## Manual Setup

### Backend API Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher recommended).
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js but can be updated independently.
- **PostgreSQL**: Install and configure [PostgreSQL 16](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database for employee data.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dreamquality/employee-management-api.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd employee-management-api
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2. Add the following environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   # Локальная база данных
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=employee_db
   DB_USER=your_local_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_local_db_password

   # Секреты
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   SECRET_WORD=your_secret_word_for_admin_registration

   # Среда разработки
   NODE_ENV=development

   # Порт (опционально, по умолчанию 3000)
   PORT=3000
   ```
   - `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`: Данные для подключения к базе данных PostgreSQL.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Секретный ключ для аутентификации JWT.
   - `SECRET_WORD`: Секретный ключ для регистрации администратора.
   - `NODE_ENV`: Указывает среду выполнения.
   - `PORT`: Порт, на котором будет работать сервер (по умолчанию 3000).

Замените `your_local_db_user`, `your_local_db_password`, `your_jwt_secret`, и `your_secret_word_for_admin_registration` на свои реальные значения.

### Running the Application

Start the server in development mode:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### API Documentation

Access the interactive API documentation at [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs) if Swagger or a similar tool is set up. This documentation provides a complete view of the available endpoints and allows for interactive testing.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update the `.env` file with the API URL:
   ```plaintext
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. Start the frontend development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

📖 **[Read the Complete Deployment Guide](DEPLOY.md)** for step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting, and best practices.

### Legacy Docker Setup (Old Method)

For backward compatibility, you can still use the old method without profiles:

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up --build
```

However, it's recommended to use the profile-based approach described in the "Quick Start with Docker" section above for better control and CI integration.

## API Documentation

Access the interactive API documentation at [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs) to view and test available endpoints.

### Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`**: Runs the app in development mode with hot reloading.
- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in production mode.
- **`npm test`**: Runs test cases for the application.
- **`npm run build:swagger`**: Generates static HTML Swagger documentation in the `docs/` folder.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints the project files to enforce consistent code style.

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and documentation deployment. Tests run automatically on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

The CI workflow uses Docker Compose with the `ci` profile:
1. Sets up environment files
2. Runs tests in isolated Docker containers using `docker compose --profile ci up`
3. Automatically cleans up containers and volumes
4. Generates Swagger documentation (only on `main` branch)
5. Deploys documentation to GitHub Pages in the `docs/` folder (only on `main` branch)

This approach ensures consistency between local development and CI environments, as both use the same Docker Compose configuration.

The generated documentation is automatically published to GitHub Pages at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/docs/` after successful test runs on the main branch.

You can view the test status in the repository's Actions tab.
